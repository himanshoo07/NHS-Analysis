# NHS-Dental-Statistics--Analysis

In this group analysis case study we aim to:

Analyse the data containing NHS Dental Statistics for England for the period April 2018 to March 2019, at the level of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). Using the data and analysis, answer the following questions:

What patterns are there in the number/age of patients treated? 

What is the effect of deprivation?

A person aged 55 in 2019 will reach the State Pension age in 2031. What types of CCGs face the greatest shortage of dentists in 2031?
